I was able to accomplish the acceptance criteria by first commenting out the HTML and taking the skeleton and pushing it all over to javascript to work in one file.
I was able to accomplish all acceptance criteria for this challenge. My biggest challenge was actually getting my colors and time segments to populate and behave properly.
I was able to accomplish almost everything in one giant for loop with different variables, objects, and event listeners.

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours of 9am&ndash;5pm
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
